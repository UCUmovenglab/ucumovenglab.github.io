Our work focuses on three main research lines:

## 1. Human Movement and Motor Control

We study human movement, focusing on locomotion and sports-relevant movements, using various tools to characterize nominal behaviors or analyzing patterns that may infer functional anomalies. We use electromyography (EMG) to record muscle activity, portable systems based on inertial measurement units (IMUs), and motion capture systems (MoCap) for kinematic and dynamic characterization.

We also seek to understand aspects of movement control by the nervous system, investigating the role of sensory information (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive) and the characteristics of muscle activity, its coordination, and adaptation.

## 2. Movement Rehabilitation Tools

We develop solutions for recovering movement impaired by central nervous system injuries, such as strokes. We address this problem through two complementary strategies:

- **Interactive tools** to induce plasticity in neuromuscular control by providing relevant feedback about patients' own muscle activity, and encouraging the recruitment of non-normotypical muscle coordination patterns.

- **Advanced orthotic devices** that, through controlled actuation systems, help accelerate rehabilitation or facilitate the learning of coordinated movements.

This line is developed in collaboration with the Health Sciences Department, Physical Therapy group.

## 3. Movement Digitalization Innovation

We develop technologies for capturing, recording, and analyzing movement, with the dual goal of facilitating access and improving capabilities. This development is organized into three key areas:

- **Computer vision-based motion capture:** In collaboration with the Artificial Intelligence group, we develop motion capture systems using automatic vision techniques and edge computing.

- **Innovative electronic device development:** We work with the Microelectronics and IoT group on creating electronic devices with enhanced capabilities for movement digitalization.

- **Advanced data processing:** We develop advanced techniques for analyzing movement signals from various modalities using Bayesian models, time-frequency analysis, and artificial intelligence approaches.
