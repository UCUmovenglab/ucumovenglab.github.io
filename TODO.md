# TODO

## Completed
- [x] make sure this builds at ucumovinglab.github.io - Updated all references
- [x] logo in footer is too small, barely visible - Increased from 40px to 70px
- [x] need pictures for team members - Downloaded from UCU investigadores portal
- [x] homepage needs to be cleaner: a full list of publications is overwhelming - Limited to 5 with "See all" link
- [x] contact us page seems marketing-y - Rewritten with academic tone
- [x] collaborators from physiotherapy should read "Departamento de Bienestar y Salud" - Fixed
- [x] collaborators should list individuals too, such as Hamlet Suárez (emérito SNI) - Added External Collaborators section
- [x] collaborators should have a former students section - Added with Juan Gandolfo, Melissa Imbert

## Pending (requires manual action)
- [ ] need pictures for research projects/lines
  - Need images for: `images/projects/motor-control.jpg`, `images/projects/rehabilitation.jpg`, `images/projects/digitalization.jpg`
  - Suggested sources: Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay (search for biomechanics, motion capture, rehabilitation)
